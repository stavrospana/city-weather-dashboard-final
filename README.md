#Module 6 Weekly Challenge - City Weather Dashboard

#Description

This web application allows you to view the upcoming weather forecast of a specific city and the five day forecast!

#Usage
Use the City Weather Dashboard here:



There will be four main sections on the page: the city search UI, the search history on the right, and today's weather as well as the five day forecast in the middle.

You can enter any city in the search bar and it will update and give a current weather forecast as well as the five day forecast in any city. You can click on recent searches in the recent search history to pull up any city that has been previously searched. There is also
local storage that will save the recent city and display the weather.
